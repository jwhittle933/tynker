# Tynker
Tynker is a functional TypeScript for library building composable, reusable application layers. The library aims to make it easier to create _semantic meaning_ in your domain, and do it functionally.

### Not your momma's TypeScript
TypeScript is pitched to developers and engineers as C# for the browser. This isn't just a bad notion, it's one of the worst ever conceived. The C#/.NET ecosystem is arguably one of the worst to work in and usually results in very stringy code that lacks any _semantic meaning_. The "descriptive thread" that stitches a .NET app together is nominal - based on a noun.
