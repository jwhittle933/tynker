## Primitives

The primitives layer in Tynker encompasses both traditional primitives as well as types and interfaces that are considered building blocks for higher level functionality for Tynker and using applications.

Another very important distinction: the primitives in Tynker do not always abide by "pure" functional rules. In some cases, returning new data just doesn't make sense (see, for example [`Node`](./node/node.ts)), whether that is for reasons of efficiency or linking between two different pieces of data.
